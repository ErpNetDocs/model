| Action | For each VoucherLine in the current document, validates that: <br> •	If (Account.LimitToBaseCurrency == FALSE), AND (Account.Currency = NULL) then Currency = any value <br> •	If (Account.LimitToBaseCurrency == FALSE), AND (Account.Currency != NULL) then Currency = Account.Currency <br>•	If (Account.LimitToBaseCurrency == TRUE), then Currency = EnterpriseCompany.BaseCurrency <br> OR EnterpriseCompany.ReportingCurrency <br> OR If (InstanceChangeRequest.ChangeKind = 'BaseCurrencyChange') <br> AND (InstanceChangeRequest.BaseCurrencyChange = 'Scheduled') <br> then Currency = InstanceChangeRequest.NewValueCurrency |
| Description | For each line in the current Accounting Voucher, the system validates the currency according to the Account’s settings. <br> If the Account is not limited to base currency (Limit To Base Currency is not check-marked) and has no specified currency, any currency is allowed in the Accounting Voucher Line. <br> If the Account is not limited to base currency (Limit To Base Currency is not check-marked) and has a specified currency, it must match the Currency in the Accounting Voucher Line.  <br> If the Account is limited to base currency (Limit To Base Currency is check-marked), then the currency used in the Accounting Voucher Line must be either the Enterprise Company's Base Currency or Reporting Currency or if there is a record of Instance Change Request where the Change Kind is ‘BaseCurrencyChange’ and its state is ‘Scheduled’ then Currency can be equal to the New Value Currency. |
| Message | Line number '{AccountingVoucherLine.LineNo}' of document '{AccountingVoucher.DisplayText}', contains an invalid currency. <br> The selected account allows only specific currencies. If the account is limited to base currency, the voucher line must use the company's base currency, reporting currency or, if there is an existing record in Instance Change Requests with the Change Kind set to ‘BaseCurrencyChange’ on State 'Scheduled', it is allowed to select the New Value Currency ‘{InstanceChangeRequest.NewValueCurrency}’. If the account allows other currencies but has a specified currency, it must match the one used in this line. <br> Please review the account's currency settings. |
