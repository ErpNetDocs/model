| Description | Once a base currency has been assigned to an enterprise company, it becomes immutable. This ensures consistency across all financial records and prevents discrepancies that could arise from changing the fundamental currency of reference. The restriction safeguards data integrity, supports accurate reporting, and aligns with standard accounting principles that require a stable base currency throughout the companyâ€™s lifecycle. |
| Message | Unable to change the value in the Base Currency field. <br> You are trying to modify the Base Currency field for Enterprise Company '{EnterpriseCompany}'. <br> The Base Currency is fixed and cannot be changed. <br> Please select Base Currency '{EnterpriseCompany.BaseCurrency}' and try again.|
